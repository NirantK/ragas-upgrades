        "- Abortion criminalization contributes to stigma around abortion and particularly on those who need, provide or assist with abortion services.\n- Criminalization, lack of information, disinformation, and stigma have severe and irreversible effects, particularly on marginalized individuals.\n- Girls and young women are kept in the dark about their rights and often forced to bring to term pregnancies resulting from sexual violence.\n- Marginalized individuals, including those living in poverty, historically discriminated against, Indigenous and Afro-descendent women, migrants, and refugees, are disproportionately affected by abortion criminalization.\n- Criminalization of abortion is the biggest contributing factor to the estimated 35 million unsafe abortions happening every year, increasing maternal mortality and morbidity.\n- Criminalizing abortion undermines access to health services and leads to increased rates of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity.\n- Abortion criminalization forces women, girls, and all pregnant individuals to attempt unsafe clandestine abortion methods, placing their life and health at risk.\n- Abortion laws in Nigeria are restrictive, making abortion unsafe and difficult to access safe abortion care.",
        "In countries where abortion is illegal or highly restricted, marginalized individuals, such as low-income women, young girls, and immigrants, are disproportionately affected. They may resort to unsafe and clandestine methods to terminate a pregnancy, putting their lives at risk. The criminalization of abortion can further perpetuate cycles of poverty, inequality, and discrimination, as marginalized individuals are denied the autonomy to make decisions about their own bodies and futures.",
        "The debate over abortion has been a contentious issue for decades, with strong opinions on both sides of the argument. The criminalization of abortion can have far-reaching consequences for marginalized individuals, particularly those who may not have access to safe and legal options for terminating a pregnancy. This can lead to increased health risks, financial burdens, and emotional distress for those who are already facing systemic barriers to healthcare and support services."

        "The determination of whether statements are considered 'false' under Article 207.3 is based on the intent behind the statements and the impact they have on the legal proceedings. If the prosecution believes that the statements were made with the purpose of obstructing justice or undermining the truth, they may be classified as 'false' and subject to legal consequences."

        "The issue of recognizing Indigenous Peoples' lands and territories as a distinct category of protected area at COP15 has been a point of contention among various stakeholders. While some argue that Indigenous Peoples' traditional knowledge and practices are essential for effective conservation efforts, others believe that a one-size-fits-all approach is more practical and efficient in achieving conservation goals.",

      "0": "Criminalizing abortion can have severe consequences for marginalized individuals, particularly those who are already facing various forms of discrimination and inequality. Some of the consequences include:\n\n1. Health risks: When abortion is criminalized, individuals may resort to unsafe and illegal methods to terminate their pregnancies, leading to serious health complications and even death. Marginalized individuals, who often have limited access to healthcare and resources, are more likely to be affected by these risks.\n\n2. Economic burden: Marginalized individuals, who are more likely to face financial constraints, may struggle to afford safe and legal abortions in countries where it is criminalized. This can lead to increased financial burdens, as they may have to travel long distances or seek expensive underground services.\n\n3. Limited reproductive choices: Criminalizing abortion restricts individuals' reproductive choices and autonomy. Marginalized individuals, who already face various barriers to accessing healthcare and education, may be further limited in their ability to make informed decisions about their reproductive health.\n\n4. Increased inequality: Criminalizing abortion disproportionately affects marginalized individuals, exacerbating existing inequalities. Women from low-income backgrounds, racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those living in rural areas often face additional barriers to accessing safe and legal abortion services, further widening the gap between privileged and marginalized groups.\n\n5. Criminalization of pregnancy: In some cases, criminalizing abortion can lead to the criminalization of pregnancy itself. This can result in the surveillance and punishment of pregnant individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities, who may be subjected to invasive monitoring, discrimination, and even imprisonment for actions perceived as harmful to the fetus.\n\n6. Mental health impact: The criminalization of abortion can have significant psychological consequences for marginalized individuals. The stigma and shame associated with seeking illegal abortions or being unable to access safe services can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and depression.\n\n7. Reproductive injustice: Criminalizing abortion perpetuates reproductive injustice by denying marginalized individuals the right to control their own bodies and make decisions about their reproductive health. It reinforces systemic inequalities and denies them the same reproductive rights and freedoms enjoyed by more privileged individuals.\n\nIt is important to note that these consequences are not limited to criminalizing abortion alone but are often intertwined with broader social, economic, and healthcare disparities faced by marginalized communities.",
      "1": "Under Article 207.3 of the Russian Criminal Code, statements contrary to the official position are considered 'false' by the prosecution when they are intentionally made with the aim of discrediting the state or its authorities, or spreading false information that could potentially harm the public interest or cause significant damage. The prosecution will consider such statements as false if they are deliberately made to mislead the public or undermine the credibility of the state.",
      "2": "At COP15, the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in 2009 in Copenhagen, Denmark, the failure to explicitly recognize Indigenous Peoples' lands and territories as a distinct category of protected area was primarily attributed to the governments of several countries. These countries included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. These governments were criticized for their reluctance to acknowledge the rights and land claims of Indigenous Peoples, which hindered the inclusion of Indigenous lands as protected areas in the conference's agreements."
